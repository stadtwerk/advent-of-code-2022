# Advent of Code 2022

> Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar.

This is the solution of the [stadt.werk GmbH](https://stadtwerk.org) developers for the AoC 2022.

## Organization

You can find the organization [here](https://stadtwerk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/stadtwerk/pages/1556119553/Advent+of+Code+2022).

## How to participate

### Prerequisites

Get the `.env` file from Fabian and put it in your root directory. It contains the session cookie for the AoC website if you want to automate the input/output.

If you want to use the AoC website, log in with the google account given in the `.env` file.

### Your code

Create a folder in the root dir of this repository and name it with the number of the day you want to solve and your name.

e.g. `01-Fabian`

Create a README in your folder and document your approach. Other then that you can use any language you want. You don't have to create a dedicated branch, just commit to the main branch. But please don't overwrite other people's solutions.

Don't forget to update the repositorys `.gitignore` file and the `AUTHORS` file. Lastly update the confluence page with a checkmark and your used technology.
